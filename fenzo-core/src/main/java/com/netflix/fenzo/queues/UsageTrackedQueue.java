/**
 * This interface represents a queue entity whose usage is tracked. Some of the methods in this class are called
 * during a scheduling iteration, and, therefore, implementations must be efficient so as to not slow down the
 * scheduler.
 * <P>
 * There are effectively two sets of methods. One set is called during a scheduling iteration. These are:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>{@link #nextTaskToLaunch()}</LI>
 *     <LI>{@link #assignTask(QueuableTask)}</LI>
 * </UL>
 * The other set is called between consecutive scheduling iterations. Scheduling iteration is marked as completed
 * by calling {@link #reset()}. The methods in this set are:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>{@link #queueTask(QueuableTask)}</LI>
 *     <LI>{@link #launchTask(QueuableTask)}</LI>
 *     <LI>{@link #removeTask(String, QAttributes)}</LI>
