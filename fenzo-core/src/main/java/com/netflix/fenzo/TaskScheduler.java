/**
 * A scheduling service that you can use to optimize the assignment of tasks to hosts within a Mesos framework.
 * Call the {@link #scheduleOnce scheduleOnce()} method with a list of task requests and a list of new resource
 * lease offers, and that method will return a set of task assignments.
 * <p>
 * The {@code TaskScheduler} stores any unused lease offers and will apply them during future calls to
 * {@code scheduleOnce()} until a time expires, which is defined by the lease offer expiry time that you set
 * when you build the {@code TaskScheduler} (the default is 10 seconds). Upon reaching the expiry time, the
 * {@code TaskScheduler} rejects expired resource lease offers by invoking the action you supplied then you
 * built the {@code TaskScheduler}.
 * <p>
 * Note that when you launch a task that has been scheduled by the {@code TaskScheduler}, you should call
 * the task assigner action available from the {@link #getTaskAssigner getTaskAssigner()} method. When that
 * task completes, you should call the task unassigner action available from the
 * {@link #getTaskUnAssigner getTaskUnAssigner()} method. These actions make the {@code TaskScheduler} keep
 * track of launched tasks. The {@code TaskScheduler} then makes these tracked tasks available to its
 * scheduling optimization functions.
 *
 * Do not call the scheduler concurrently. The scheduler assigns tasks in the order that they are received in a
 * particular list. It checks each task against available resources until it finds a match.
 * <p>
 * You create your {@code TaskScheduler} by means of the {@link TaskScheduler.Builder}. It provides methods with
 * which you can adjust the scheduler's autoscaling rules, fitness calculators, and so forth.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">Wikipedia: Builder pattern</a>

     * Schedule a list of task requests by using any newly-added resource leases in addition to any
     * previously-unused leases. This is the main scheduling method that attempts to assign resources to task
     * requests. Resource leases are associated with a host name. A host can have zero or more leases. Leases
     * that the scheduler does not use in this scheduling run it stores for later use until they expire.
     * <p>
     * You cannot add a lease object with an Id equal to that of a stored lease object; {@code scheduleOnce()}
     * will throw an {@code IllegalStateException}. Upon throwing this exception, if you provided multiple
     * leases in the {@code newLeases} argument, the state of internally maintained list of unused leases will
     * be in an indeterminate state - some of the leases may have been successfully added.
     * <p>
     * The task scheduler rejects any expired leases before scheduling begins. Then, it combines all leases of a
     * host to determine the total available resources on the host. The scheduler then tries each task request,
     * in the order that they appear in the given list, for assignment against the available hosts until
     * successful. For each task the scheduler returns either a successful assignment result, or, a set of
     * assignment failures.
     * <p>
     * After the scheduler evaluates all assignments, it will reject remaining leases if they are unused and
     * their offer time is further in the past than lease expiration interval. This prevents the scheduler from
     * hoarding leases. If you provided an autoscaler, the scheduler then launches autoscale evaluation to run
     * asynchronously, which runs each registered autoscale rule based on its policy.
     * <p>
     * The successful assignments contain hosts to which tasks have been successfully assigned and the offers for that
     * host that were used for the assignments. Fenzo removes those offers from its internal state. Normally, you
     * would use those offers to launch the tasks. For any reason if you do not launch those tasks, you must either
     * reject the offers to Mesos, or, re-add them to Fenzo with the next call to {@link #scheduleOnce(List, List)}.
     * Otherwise, those offers would be "leaked out".
     * <p>
     * Unexpected exceptions may arise during scheduling, for example, due to uncaught exceptions in user provided
     * plugins. The scheduling routine stops upon catching any unexpected exceptions. These exceptions are surfaced to
     * you in one or both of two ways.
