        // A naive approach to figuring out shortfall of hosts to satisfy the tasks that failed assignments is,
        // strictly speaking, not possible by just attempting to add up required resources for the tasks and then mapping
        // that to the number of hosts required to satisfy that many resources. Several things can make that evaluation
        // wrong, including:
        //     - tasks may have a choice to be satisfied by multiple types of hosts
        //     - tasks may have constraints (hard and soft) that alter scheduling decisions
        //
        // One approach that would work very well is by trying to schedule them all by mirroring the scheduler's logic,
        // by giving it numerous "free" resources of each type defined in the autoscale rules. Scheduling the failed tasks
        // on sufficient free resources should tell us how many resources are needed. However, we need to make sure this
        // process does not step on the original scheduler's state information. Or, if it does, it can be reliably undone.
        //
        // However, setting up the free resources is not defined yet since it involves setting up the appropriate
        // VM attributes that we have no knowledge of.
        //
        // Therefore, we fall back to a naive approach that is conservative enough to work for now.
        // We assume that each task may need an entire new VM. This has the effect of aggressively scaling up. This
        // is better than falling short of resources, so we will go with it. The scale down will take care of things when
        // shortfall is taken care of.
        // We need to ensure, though, that we don't ask for resources for the same tasks multiple times. That is, we
        // maintain the list of tasks for which we have already requested resources. So, we ask again only if we notice
        // new tasks. There can be some scenarios where a resource that we asked got used up for a task other than the one
        // we asked for. Although, this is unlikely in FIFO queuing of tasks. So, we maintain the list of tasks with a
        // timeout and unqueueTask it from there so we catch this scenario and ask for the resources again for that task.
